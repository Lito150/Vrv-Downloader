## Updates would happen when I have the time.

# Vrv Downloader

It's an app which helps you download videos off VRV.Had only tried to download crunchyroll anime off it,premium anime won't work so does Hidive unless you have a premium account which you could try with the "Reqauires Premium" box.No gurantees it would work since i don't own a premium account.

The coding isn't that well done since I'm self thought so expect bugs/errors,also report via the Issues if they aries I would try my best to fix.

## Here's a Preview of it
