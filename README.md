# Vrv Downloader

It's an app which helps you download videos of Vrv.It's a modified version of skid9000's Crunchyroll-Downloader,since his/her tool is under AGPLv3 license which requires the develepor to release the source code.Therefore I won't release this downloader anytime soon and since I would like to add more function to it(aka. redesign it with more cool stuff).Tell me your thoughts about it and if i should release it?I've only tested it with crunchyroll anime on vrv and it works without account,Hidive and others might require an account to download.

## Here's a Preview of it
